> Created to create

Bara (a Hebrew word which mean: `created`) is the new framework to build your applications (front-end), microservices (back-end) based on Reactive Functional Programming techniques.

Bara help you create almost anything you can imaging with the stream of events, conditions, actions. All you have to do is build your module based on Bara's specs and plug it in to the Bara framework.

**Specs are not finished yet. We use the following tag system to identify their state:**

- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-orange.svg?style=flat-square) - this spec is a work-in-progress, it is likely not even complete.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-draft-yellow.svg?style=flat-square) - this spec is a rough draft and will likely change substantially.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-reliable-green.svg?style=flat-square) - this spec is believed to be close to final. Minor changes only.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square) - this spec is likely to improve, but not change fundamentally.
- ![permanent](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-permanent-teal.svg?style=flat-square) - this spec will not change.
